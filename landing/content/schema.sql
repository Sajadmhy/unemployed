-- The whole database for the wall. Paste this into the Neon SQL editor once.
--
-- No migration tool, deliberately. One table, of names, that will not change
-- shape. Alembic exists in this project for the app's own schema, which is a
-- different database on a different machine.
--
-- There is no raw IP in here, only a salted hash of one.
--
-- There is an email column, added later than the rest. It is the one field in
-- this database that would matter if it leaked, so it is written but never
-- read back out: no query that feeds a page selects it, and it is deliberately
-- absent from the SignupRow type, because that type is serialised into the
-- HTML every visitor receives.
--
-- An address is only ever written next to an `email_asked_at`, so "was this
-- person told" is answerable from the row rather than from memory of what the
-- copy said on the day.

-- Google's `sub` for the account that owns this row: stable, opaque, and not
-- an email address. This is the whole of what signing in adds to the database,
-- which is why there is no adapter and no users/accounts/sessions tables.
alter table signups add column if not exists google_sub text;

-- The email on the Google account, so there is a way to reach people about the
-- thing they signed up for.
--
-- Nullable, and null for everyone who joined before this column existed. Their
-- address was never stored and cannot be recovered: `google_sub` is opaque and
-- Google offers no lookup from it back to an address. The only way those rows
-- ever get filled in is that person coming back to /join and saying yes.
alter table signups add column if not exists email text;

-- When they were shown what happens to the address and answered.
--
-- Set on both answers, because the question is "have we asked", not "did they
-- agree": someone who said no has to stay asked, or they get the same panel
-- every time they open the page. Yes fills `email` in the same statement, no
-- leaves it null. So the two states read cleanly:
--
--   email_asked_at is null                 never asked
--   email_asked_at set, email null         asked, said no
--   email_asked_at set, email set          asked, said yes
--
-- Nothing writes `email` without also writing this, so an address with no
-- `email_asked_at` beside it is a bug rather than a state.
--
-- Null for everyone who joined before this column existed. They signed up under
-- copy that said their address was not stored, so /join stops and asks them
-- once rather than redirecting them past the sentence that replaced it.

-- The rate limit lookup, which runs inside the insert.
create index if not exists signups_ip_hash_created_at_idx on signups (ip_hash, created_at desc);

-- One row per browser. Partial, so the many null client_ids do not collide.
create unique index if not exists signups_client_id_key
  on signups (client_id) where client_id is not null;
