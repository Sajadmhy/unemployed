/**
 * The people, behind the headline.
 *
 * Everyone who has joined is on screen when the page opens, which does the
 * arguing a testimonial section would otherwise have to do.
 *
 * It used to scatter faces by hashing their seed. That read as a crowd at
 * twenty seven people and as a mess at a thousand, and it could only ever show
 * the handful that fitted the screen. It is a grid now, laid out column by
 * column, and it drifts sideways on its own. Hovering a face stops it, and it
 * can still be dragged.
 *
 * The middle of the hero is masked out rather than kept empty by placement.
 * That is what lets the grid be one continuous surface instead of two separate
 * gutters that would have to scroll in opposite directions to stay symmetric.
 */

/**
 * How many people the hero shows before it starts repeating them.
 *
 * This is a cost limit, not a design one. Every face is an image request, and
 * the drift pulls a new column into view roughly every two and a half seconds,
 * so a hero that walked the whole wall charged about two and a quarter requests
 * per second for as long as a tab stayed open. Ninety seconds of that was three
 * hundred requests from one reader, and it grew with the wall.
 *
 * Capping it makes the cost converge instead. The loop repeats the same faces,
 * the browser already has them, and once the first lap is done an idle tab costs
 * nothing at all. A hundred and eighty is thirty columns, so a lap takes about
 * eighty seconds. Everyone, genuinely everyone, is still on /wall.
 *
 * It has to divide by LOOP_ROWS.
